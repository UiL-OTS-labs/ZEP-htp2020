Baby experiment using the head turn paradigm

# This task is used to run a head turn paradigm.


## Familiarization
In the habituation phase trials are presented as described above. After
the sixth trial on we examine whether the infant meets the habituation
criterion. This criterion is met once the mean cumulative looking time of the
last three trial is less then 65% of the first threesome. Once the criterion
is met the test phase is started.

## Test phase


#finish
The experiment finishes after a happy song is played along with some infant
friendly pictures.
